
# Dynamic Data Table Manager

This project is my solution for the frontend internship assignment at SUREFY TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (React)
- Redux Toolkit (for state)
- Material UI v5 (UI components)
- TypeScript
- PapaParse & FileSaver.js (CSV import/export)
- React Hook Form (forms handling)

## Features

- Table view with Name, Email, Age, Role (and more columns can be added)
- Sort, search, and paginate data (10 rows/page)
- Dynamic column management (show/hide columns, add new fields)
- Import and Export CSV with correct columns
- (Optional) Inline editing, delete, dark/light theme, responsive layout

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo and run `npm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open a web browser at `http://localhost:3000`
4. Try adding columns, toggling visibility, importing/exporting data

## What I learned / customizations

- I learned how to manage dynamic table layouts and custom column sets using Redux and Material UI.
- My column manager allows adding custom fields and hiding/showing columns.
- I added helpful validation and error messages for data input and import.
- If I had more time, I'd add drag-and-drop and more advanced filtering.

## Notes

The code is hand-crafted for the assignment and organized for clarity.
